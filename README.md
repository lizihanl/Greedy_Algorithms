# Greedy_Algorithms
1. Read a data file containing a list of meeting requests for one day
2. Use a greedy algorithm to select a set of scheduled meetings for the day
3. Display the count, and the names of the groups that were selected
4. Repeat steps 2 & 3 for two more greedy algorithms (so we can compare their effectiveness in finding the best answer)
